## 💡 How to Verify Data is Real

### 1. Check Data Source Badges
Each component shows a badge indicating data source:
- 🟢 Green = Real government data
- 🟡 Yellow = Estimated from real data
- 🔵 Blue = Calculated from real data

### 2. Cross-Reference with Official Sources
- NOAA Alerts: https://www.weather.gov/
- FEMA Declarations: https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations
- USGS Earthquakes: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/

### 3. Check Last Updated Time
Dashboard shows "Last updated" timestamp indicating when real data was fetched.

### 4. Use Test API Page
Visit `/test-api` to see raw API responses and verify data is coming from real sources.

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Current Implementation
```typescript
// All APIs called in parallel for speed
const [alertsData, disastersData, historicalData, earthquakeData] =
  await Promise.all([
    getWeatherAlerts(state),      // ~500ms
    getFEMADisasters(state),       // ~800ms
    getHistoricalData(state),      // ~1000ms
    getEarthquakes(lat, lon, 500), // ~600ms
  ]);
```

**Total Load Time**: ~1-2 seconds (fastest API response time)

### Recommended Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Cache responses to reduce API calls
const cache = {
  weather: 5 * 60 * 1000,    // 5 minutes
  fema: 15 * 60 * 1000,      // 15 minutes
  earthquakes: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  historical: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
};
```
